      <h2>Here more about of <span>J. Robert Oppenheimer</span> </h2>

      <p>Julius Robert Oppenheimer April 22, 1904 February 18, 1967 was an American
        theoretical physicist and director of the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. He is often credited as the
        "father
        of the atomic bomb" for his role in organizing the Manhattan Project, the research and development undertaking
        that
        created the first nuclear weapons.

        Born in New York City to Jewish immigrants from Germany, Oppenheimer earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry
        from
        Harvard University in 1925 and a PhD in physics from the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1927. After
        research at
        other institutions, he joined the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became
        a full
        professor in 1936. He made significant contributions to theoretical physics, including achievements in quantum
        mechanics
        and nuclear physics such as the Born Oppenheimer approximation for molecular wave functions, work on the theory
        of
        electrons and positrons, the Oppenheimer Phillips process in nuclear fusion, and the first prediction of quantum
        tunneling. With his students, he also made contributions to the theory of neutron stars and black holes, quantum
        field
        theory, and the interactions of cosmic rays.

        In 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, and in 1943 was appointed director of the
        project's
        Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the
        start of the
        German nuclear weapons program.His leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project's
        success. On July 16, 1945, he was present at the first test of the atomic bomb, Trinity. In August 1945, the
        weapons
        were used against Japan in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That remains the only use of nuclear weapons
        in an
        armed conflict.

        In 1947, Oppenheimer became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and
        chaired the
        influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission. He lobbied
        for
        international control of nuclear power, to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet
        Union. He
        opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb during a 1949 1950 governmental debate on the question and
        subsequently
        took positions on defense-related issues that provoked the ire of some U.S. government and military factions.
        During the
        Second Red Scare, Oppenheimer's stances, together with past associations he had with people and organizations
        affiliated
        with the Communist Party USA, led to the revocation of his security clearance following a 1954 security hearing.
        This
        effectively ended his access to the government's atomic secrets and thus his career as a nuclear physicist.
        Stripped
        also of his direct political influence, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write, and work in physics. In 1963,
        he was
        awarded the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation.
